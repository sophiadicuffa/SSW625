For example ""a"" is a valid identifier because `x.a` is valid javascript syntax, where `x` is a variable that stands for an arbitrary object.

And ""0' is not a valid identifier because `x.0` isn't valid javascript syntax, where `x` is a variable that stands for an arbitrary object.

Please try to stick to official javascript specs if possible.

Keep in mind there are many possible identifiers across the Unicode range, for instance `á` and `見` also are valid."

Please ask me as many questions as will help you in preparation of Dockefile and other required files,

Here is description of project from it's README.md file:

```
# localGPT

This project was inspired by the original [privateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT). Most of the description here is inspired by the original privateGPT.

For detailed overview of the project, Watch this [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/MlyoObdIHyo).

In this model, I have replaced the GPT4ALL model with Vicuna-7B model and we are using the InstructorEmbeddings instead of LlamaEmbeddings as used in the original privateGPT. Both Embeddings as well as LLM will run on GPU instead of CPU. It also has CPU support if you do not have a GPU (see below for instruction).

Ask questions to your documents without an internet connection, using the power of LLMs. 100% private, no data leaves your execution environment at any point. You can ingest documents and ask questions without an internet connection!

Built with [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and [Vicuna-7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/vicuna-7B-1.1-HF) and [InstructorEmbeddings](https://instructor-embedding.github.io/)

# Environment Setup

In order to set your environment up to run the code here, first install all requirements:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then install AutoGPTQ - if you want to run quantized models for GPU

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ.git
cd AutoGPTQ
git checkout v0.2.2
pip install .
```

For more support on [AutoGPTQ] (https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ).

## Test dataset

This repo uses a [Constitution of USA ](https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf) as an example.

## Instructions for ingesting your own dataset

Put any and all of your .txt, .pdf, or .csv files into the SOURCE_DOCUMENTS directory
in the load_documents() function, replace the docs_path with the absolute path of your source_documents directory.

The current default file types are .txt, .pdf, .csv, and .xlsx, if you want to use any other file type, you will need to convert it to one of the default file types.

Run the following command to ingest all the data.

```shell
python ingest.py  # defaults to cuda
```

Use the device type argument to specify a given device.

```sh
python ingest.py --device_type cpu
```

Use help for a full list of supported devices.

```sh
python ingest.py --help
```

It will create an index containing the local vectorstore. Will take time, depending on the size of your documents.
You can ingest as many documents as you want, and all will be accumulated in the local embeddings database.
If you want to start from an empty database, delete the `index`.

Note: When you run this for the first time, it will download take time as it has to download the embedding model. In the subseqeunt runs, no data will leave your local enviroment and can be run without internet connection.

## Ask questions to your documents, locally!

In order to ask a question, run a command like:

```shell
python run_localGPT.py
```

And wait for the script to require your input.

```shell
> Enter a query:
```

Hit enter. Wait while the LLM model consumes the prompt and prepares the answer. Once done, it will print the answer and the 4 sources it used as context from your documents; you can then ask another question without re-running the script, just wait for the prompt again.

Note: When you run this for the first time, it will need internet connection to download the vicuna-7B model. After that you can turn off your internet connection, and the script inference would still work. No data gets out of your local environment.

Type `exit` to finish the script.

# Run it on CPU

By default, localGPT will use your GPU to run both the `ingest.py` and `run_localGPT.py` scripts. But if you do not have a GPU and want to run this on CPU, now you can do that (Warning: Its going to be slow!). You will need to use `--device_type cpu`flag with both scripts.

For Ingestion run the following:

```shell
python ingest.py --device_type cpu
```

In order to ask a question, run a command like:

```shell
python run_localGPT.py --device_type cpu
```

# Run the UI

1. Start by opening up `run_localGPT_API.py` in a code editor of your choice. If you are using gpu skip to step 3.

2. If you are running on cpu change `DEVICE_TYPE = 'cuda'` to `DEVICE_TYPE = 'cpu'`.

   - Comment out the following:

   ```shell
   model_id = ""TheBloke/WizardLM-7B-uncensored-GPTQ""
   model_basename = ""WizardLM-7B-uncensored-GPTQ-4bit-128g.compat.no-act-order.safetensors""
   LLM = load_model(device_type=DEVICE_TYPE, model_id=model_id, model_basename = model_basename)
   ```

   - Uncomment:

   ```shell
   model_id = ""TheBloke/guanaco-7B-HF"" # or some other -HF or .bin model
   LLM = load_model(device_type=DEVICE_TYPE, model_id=model_id)
   ```

   - If you are running gpu there should be nothing to change. Save and close `run_localGPT_API.py`.

3. Open up a terminal and activate your python environment that contains the dependencies installed from requirements.txt.

4. Navigate to the `/LOCALGPT` directory.

5. Run the following command `python run_localGPT_API.py`. The API should being to run.

6. Wait until everything has loaded in. You should see something like `INFO:werkzeug:Press CTRL+C to quit`.

7. Open up a second terminal and activate the same python environment.

8. Navigate to the `/LOCALGPT/localGPTUI` directory.

9. Run the command `python localGPTUI.py`.

10. Open up a web browser and go the address `http://localhost:5111/`.

# How does it work?

Selecting the right local models and the power of `LangChain` you can run the entire pipeline locally, without any data leaving your environment, and with reasonable performance.

- `ingest.py` uses `LangChain` tools to parse the document and create embeddings locally using `InstructorEmbeddings`. It then stores the result in a local vector database using `Chroma` vector store.
- `run_localGPT.py` uses a local LLM (Vicuna-7B in this case) to understand questions and create answers. The context for the answers is extracted from the local vector store using a similarity search to locate the right piece of context from the docs.
- You can replace this local LLM with any other LLM from the HuggingFace. Make sure whatever LLM you select is in the HF format.

# How to select different LLM models?

The following will provide instructions on how you can select a different LLM model to create your response:

1. Open up `run_localGPT.py`
2. Go to `def main(device_type, show_sources)`
3. Go to the comment where it says `# load the LLM for generating Natural Language responses`
4. Below it, it details a bunch of examples on models from HuggingFace that have already been tested to be run with the original trained model (ending with HF or have a .bin in its ""Files and versions""), and quantized models (ending with GPTQ or have a .no-act-order or .safetensors in its ""Files and versions"").
5. For models that end with HF or have a .bin inside its ""Files and versions"" on its HuggingFace page.

   - Make sure you have a model_id selected. For example -> `model_id = ""TheBloke/guanaco-7B-HF""`
   - If you go to its HuggingFace [Site] (https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/guanaco-7B-HF) and go to ""Files and versions"" you will notice model files that end with a .bin extension.

# System Requirements

## Python Version

To use this software, you must have Python 3.10 or later installed. Earlier versions of Python will not compile.

## C++ Compiler

If you encounter an error while building a wheel during the `pip install` process, you may need to install a C++ compiler on your computer.

### For Windows 10/11

To install a C++ compiler on Windows 10/11, follow these steps:

1. Install Visual Studio 2022.
2. Make sure the following components are selected:
   - Universal Windows Platform development
   - C++ CMake tools for Windows
3. Download the MinGW installer from the [MinGW website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).
4. Run the installer and select the ""gcc"" component.

### NVIDIA Driver's Issues:

Follow this [page](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-the-nvidia-drivers-on-ubuntu-22-04) to install NVIDIA Drivers.

### M1/M2 Macbook users:

1- Follow this [page](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/) to build up PyTorch with Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) support. PyTorch uses the new MPS backend for GPU training acceleration. It is good practice to verify mps support using a simple Python script as mentioned in the provided link.

2- By following the page, here is an example of what you may initiate in your terminal

```shell
xcode-select --install
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch-nightly
pip install chardet
pip install cchardet
pip uninstall charset_normalizer
pip install charset_normalizer
pip install pdfminer.six
pip install xformers
```

3- Please keep in mind that the quantized models are not yet supported by Apple Silicon (M1/M2) by auto-gptq library that is being used for loading quantized models, [see here](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ/issues/133#issuecomment-1575002893). Therefore, you will not be able to run quantized models on M1/M2.

# High level description

Rotations are a key component of attitude and orientation parameters. At first, ANISE only supports Direct Cosine Matrix math. This is a redundant representation of rotations and therefore not an optimal one.

The purpose of this issue is to design and implement a _correct_ SO(3) group for use in ANISE. Currently, work by Greg and Chris in commit 04b719f76a36d97be31941e4480f2da6a18c1381, have an early draft of what is needed for rotations in src/math/rotation/mod.rs.

# Requirements

1. Rotation structures shall be [composable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition)

   2. Composition between different representations shall use the most efficient calculation that maintains accuracy (efficient as ""least number of instructions"", as determined by iai/cachegrind)
2. Rotations shall check the source and destination frames to prevent invalid rotations (this can probably not be done at compile time)
3. The following representations shall be supported at a minimum:
   1. Direct Cosine Matrix (DCM)
   2. Quaternions shall be supported in their ""natural"" form (i, j, k, scalar), but a conversion to and from Shuster notation shall also be supported (https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/2021/05/10/beware-the-natural-quaternion/)

   4. Representations shall be unambiguous on initialization and getters (e.g. a quaterion shall not be publicly indexable because that's confusion to the user who might not remember the storage order)
4. All representations shall provide relevant helpers
   1. Quaternions shall provide at a minimum a conjugate function and a ""short direction"" function
   2. MRPs shall provide at a minimum a shadow set representation
5. All computations shall be checked for math domain errors and return `AniseError::MathError` where relevant.
6. All representation shall allow for rotation of both vectors and matrices (and ensure that matrices are rotated using `C^T * A * C`)

I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload (includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could) and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.

I'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.

I have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.

I'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.

Hopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt."

The API is only meant for local use in a web UI hosted from the same web server, so it has an appropriate restrictive CORS configuration. Since it's local only, we have not added any form of authentication.

However, a user raised an issue that cross-origin POST requests can still be made, but their responses won't be seen by the origin. This would potentially let attackers create spam data using some of the POST endpoints.

I want an analysis and ways to address the issue."

seems like semi similar concept except versioning seems to expect you to either call each of the relevant scripts yourself or write some kind of tool to do so? And also keeps track of dependencies between migrations - this doesn't seem to do that? I guess in practice you copy the migrations sql in this project into beginning of every migration file? do you keep a separate folder that has rollbacks? (but I don't see code in this repo that deletes from the applied_migrations table)"

To run it you need to use ast.parse() and then find the FunctionDef in the result.

Try running that against this function and show me the result:

Assign a `precision` label to each of these terms that captures the extent to which they correspond to patient populations with distinguishing clinical, demographic, physiological or molecular characteristics. Use exactly one of the following values for this label:

- `high`: High precision terms have the greatest ontological specificity, sometimes (but not necessarily) correspond to small groups of relatively homogeneous patients, often have greater diagnostic certainty and typically represent the forefront of clinical practice.
- `medium`: Medium precision terms are the ontological ancestors of `high` precision terms (if any are known), often include indications in later stage clinical trials and generally reflect groups of patients assumed to be suffering from a condition with a shared, or at least similar, physiological or environmental origin.
- `low`: Low precision terms are the ontological ancestors of both `medium` and `high` precision terms, group collections of diseases with *some* shared characteristics and typically connote a relatively heterogenous patient population. They are often terms used within the ontology for organizational purposes.
